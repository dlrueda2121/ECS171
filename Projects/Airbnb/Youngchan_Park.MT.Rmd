## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read_csv("~/Desktop/2020 Spring Q/STA141A/AB_NYC_2019.csv")
```
```{r step_2, warning=FALSE}
df %>%
  group_by(room_type, neighbourhood_group) %>%
  count(room_type) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(as.factor(room_type), n, fill=room_type), stat = 'identity')+
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = 'Number of Type Room by Neighbour group',
       x='Room Type', 
       y='Count')+
  facet_wrap(~neighbourhood_group, ncol = 2)+
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
df %>% leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addMarkers(~longitude, ~ latitude, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
As we can see in the Map, in Mahatan, there are Airbnb in almost apartments, eventhough an apartment have 3 rooms rental.
